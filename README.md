# Selenium Automation Assignment (C#)

## Objective
Your task is to automate interactions with a sample HTML web page using Selenium in C#. The assignment is designed to test your understanding of Selenium commands, actions, and basic principles of C# programming.

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio (or any other C# IDE)
- Selenium WebDriver for C#
- A web browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver for Firefox)

## Setup
1. **Clone/Download the Project**: Start by cloning or downloading the project repository containing the sample HTML file.
2. **Setup Selenium**: Install Selenium WebDriver via NuGet package manager in your C# project.
3. **Web Browser Driver**: Ensure you have the appropriate web browser driver installed and it's accessible in your project path.

## Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize WebDriver
- Initialize the WebDriver and navigate to the local HTML page.

### Step 2: Interact with Form Elements
- Locate and input text in the 'Name' and 'Email' fields.
- Select an option from the dropdown.
- Interact with checkboxes and validate if they are checked/unchecked.

### Step 3: Form Submission
- Implement a click action on the 'Submit' button.
- Add logic to ensure the 'Agree to terms and conditions' checkbox is checked before submission.

### Step 4: Drag and Drop Action
- Implement a drag-and-drop action from one div element to another.

### Step 5: Validations
- Validate if the elements are present and visible on the page.
- Verify if the correct alert messages/pop-ups are displayed (if any).

### Step 6: Clean Up
- Ensure the browser closes after the test execution.

## Additional Challenges
- Implement error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Use Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better code maintenance.

## Submission
- Submit your C# script file(s).
- Include a brief report explaining your approach, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness of Selenium commands and actions.
- Adherence to C# coding standards and best practices.
- Implementation of OOP concepts.
- Clarity and efficiency of the code.
